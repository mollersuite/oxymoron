	Oxymoron is the only Fediverse server you can deploy to Vercel. Also the second Fediverse server
	you can deploy to Cloudflare. And the first for Netlify, Deno Deploy, Render, Cloud Run...
	notice a pattern?
</p>
<p>
	Normally a Fediverse server is hosted by either a news organization, an Arch Linux user, or <a
		href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Script_builder">a SB player.</a>
	Because they're the only people who can figure out how. Mastodon's install instructions are 9 pages
	long and highly imperative. NixOS users are fucked. Meanwhile, Oxymoron doesn't even imply a filesystem.
	You can even host it on Windows! We've succesfully tested Oxymoron on a budget phone from 2018.
</p>
<p>
	This is possible because Oxymoron bundles to about 4 zero-dependency Node.js scripts. Nothing
	external. Node runs everywhere; you probably have 4 copies of it on your computer right now.
